### Announcements

* <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/MiddleburyMathematics/posts/1813967485555027">Middlebury Math Department Fall Hike</a> up Snake Mountain on Saturday October 22nd. Meet in front of Warner at 1pm.
* <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-ggplot2-brushing/">Lookit</a>. To recreate
    + Click Source Code on top left
    + Copy and paste into a new `.Rmd` file
    + Install the `flexdashboard` package by running `install.packages("flexdashboard", type = "source")` (more info on this package <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">here</a>)
    + Click "Run Document"
* Comments about HW-2:
    + You're still going to need to make a prediction on a user's sex even if their job is listed as `NA`
    + Say I just guessed "female" for a random sample of 1000 users. What proportion of the time will I be right? Think of this fact when you compare male vs female proportions for a given level of a categorical variable.
* Time spent on HW-1:

~~~~~
library(dplyr)
c(4,4,5,5,6,6.5,7,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,11) %>% boxplot(horizontal=TRUE)
~~~~~
