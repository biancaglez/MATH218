### Installing Necessary Geospatial Packages on macOS Take 2

1. Install `brew` by following by the instruction here: <http://brew.sh/>,
following any instructions that may pop up. `brew` is a package manager for
macOS that makes it much easier to UNIX (not R) packages onto macOS, which runs
on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxIPcbmo1_U" target =

1. Install the UNIX version of the `geos` and `gdal` geospatial packages. These
are packages that allow you to work with maps (project the globe onto a 2D page,
import shapefiles, etc.). Run the following two lines in Terminal
    + `brew install geos`
    + `brew install gdal`
1. Install the `rgeos` and `rgdal` R packages. These are R packages that allow R
to interface with the above geospatial packages. Run the following two lines in R:
    + `install.packages("rgeos", repos="https://cran.rstudio.com/", type="source")`
    + `install.packages("rgdal", repos="https://cran.rstudio.com/", type="source")`
