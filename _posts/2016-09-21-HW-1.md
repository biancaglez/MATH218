### After-Class Updates

I will centralize all updates on the homework here. Please check this page
before asking any questions to see if it has already been answered.

* On Line 12 where it says `{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}`, 
remove the `, cache=TRUE` part so that it only says `{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}`
* Question 4: Replace the original wording of the question since the dataset only consists of flights
departing Houston IAH
    + Original: I want to know proportionately what regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies **to/from** Houston in the month of July.
    + New: I want to know proportionately what regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies **from** Houston in the month of July.
