### Announcements

* Wednesday we are in the Library with Brenda, Alex, and Katherine speaking.
* [GitHub](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/business/internet-problems-attack.html) was in fact down.
* Check it out:
  + How to quickly compute proportions without creating two separate tables (one 
for numerator and one for denominator) by `group_by()` but then instead of 
`summarise()`, use a `mutate()`
  + Also, install the `plotly` package
  + Then...

~~~~
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Compute proportions with only one table
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl, am) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = n/sum(n),
    prop = round(prop, 2)
  )
  
# Check it out...
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=as.factor(am))) +
  geom_point()
ggplotly()
