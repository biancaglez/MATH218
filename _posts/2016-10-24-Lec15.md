### Announcements

* You learn something new everyday (back of `dplyr` cheatsheet, middle column,
bottom). How to quickly compute proportions without creating two separate tables
(one for numerator and one for denominator) by `group_by()` but then instead of
`summarise()`, use a `mutate()`

~~~~
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl, am) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = n/sum(n),
    prop = round(prop, 2)
  )
