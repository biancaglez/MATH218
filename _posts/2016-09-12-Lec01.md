### Announcements

* Handed out reading for Monday 9/19: [A layered grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) by Wickham.


### In-Class

* <a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/Topics/master/Lec01%20Data%20Manipulation%20with%20dplyr/Lec01.html" target = "_blank">Slides</a>: Tidy data, data manipulation verbs, and piping `%>%`.
* In-class exercise:
    + Code: `Lec01.R`  


For the rest of the class, please download any Code or Data files listed above
from GitHub as follows:

* Click on the GitHub link above
* Navigate to the corresponding lecture folder
* Click on the relevant file
* Click on the "Raw" button
* In your browser, go to *File* -> *Save As...* and save the file **without**
`.txt` in the file name

Then please change the default application to open `.R` files to RStudio. You
only need to do this once (unfortunately I don't know how to do this on Windows):

* Navigate to `Lec01.R` in a Finder window
* Right click the file and select *Open With* -> *Get Info*
* Under *Open with:* select RStudio and click *Change All...*


### After-Class Updates

Connor pointed out an error with lines 134-136 in the original [Lec01.R](https://github.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/Topics/blob/master/Lec01%20Data%20Manipulation%20with%20dplyr/Lec01.R)
file. The command `add_rownames()` has been deprecated i.e. dropped.  Replace these lines with the following, which uses the function `rownames_to_column()` from the `tibble` package:

~~~~
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>% 
  rename("make_model"=rowname)
~~~~

The `::` in `tibble::` serves two functions:

* Sometimes two packages can have the same function name, like `filter()` exists in multiple packages. The `::` disambiguates which package.
* You can use a function from a package without loading the package itself using `library()`. So the above code block is identical in function to:

~~~~
library(tibble)

mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  rename("make_model"=rowname)
~~~~
