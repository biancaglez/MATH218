### Announcements

* Please sign up on Doodle from Monday's lecture for Feedback session. For your session, please try to have your data loaded into RStudio.
* Math Talk: Tuesday Nov 8th 12:30pm Warner Hemicycle (free pizza at 12:15) <a href = "http://rudeboybert.github.io/presentations/2016-11-01-math_chats.pdf" target = "_blank">"The Statistical Modeling Of Interspecies Competition On The Growth Of Trees"</a>
* Homework 4 is now posted in the Calendar section. Note:
    + This is the last substantive HW. HW-5 will be lighter to allow you to work on your final projects.
    + Library discussion is after Thanksgiving break.


### In-Class

<!--
* <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Effective_Analyst.pdf" target = "_blank">The Effective Analyst</a>
* I want you to hit the wall. Google interview strategy.
* 
* See my MATH 116 <a href = "https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH116/assets/PS/PS-06_discussion.html" target = "_blank">Problem Set 06 Discussion</a>: Go in with a plan
* As I said in lab on Thursday, unless you are **extremely** comfortable with
the tools of `ggplot2` and `dplyr`, do not attempt to answer the questions below
immediately in this R Markdown file. Rather, focus on separating the
    + **"What"** you are going to do: the blueprint/plan
    + **"How"** you are going to do it:  `ggplot2` and `dplyr` coding
* Confusing the "what" and the "how" will only make this task more difficult.
* For example, the "what" step could be tackled as follows:
    + Draw on paper, a blackboard, or a whiteboard what your starting data frames
    look like and
        1. what your resulting data frames should look like
        1. what any visualizations should look like
    + Write out in 
    [pseudocode](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/pseudocode-111128151539-phpapp02/95/introduction-to-pseudocode-38-638.jpg?cb=1393513763)
    what your R code will look like. Pseudocode is informal and rough code that 
    doesn't necessarily need to work, but still illustrates what you want to do.
    More than anything else, writing pseudocode out forces you to think your
    plan out loud.
* Only after you a plan for the "what" should you start the "how" i.e. coding.
* I **HIGHLY** encourage you to work in groups on this problem set, on both the
"what" and "how" stages.
