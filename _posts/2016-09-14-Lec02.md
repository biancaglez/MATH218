### Announcements

* Homework 0 is now posted in the Calendar section.
* I change things up to the last minute, so please don't copy any files until the start of lecture.
* If there are ever any minor notes I need to pass along after lecture is over, 
such as minor bugs I didn't notice, I will always post them in the section 
titled **After-Class Updates**. For example, in Lec01 I added a note on the use of `::` in 
`PACKAGE_NAME::FUNCTION_NAME()`
* Went over solutions to `Lec01.R`
