### Announcements

* Homework 0 is now posted in the Calendar section, for which I will do a quick demo
of R Markdown.
* If there are ever any minor notes I need to pass along after lecture is over, 
such as minor bugs I didn't notice, I will always post them in the section 
titled **After-Class Updates**. For example, in Lec01 I added a note on the use
of `::` in `PACKAGE_NAME::FUNCTION_NAME()`.
* Go over solutions to `Lec01.R`, which are at the beginning of `Lec02.R`.


### In-Class

* <a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/Topics/master/Lec02%20More%20dplyr/Lec02.html" target = "_blank">Slides</a>:
An example involving R's webscraping abilities to collect data
* In-class exercise:
    + Packages to install: the `rvest` and `XML` packages
    + Code: `Lec02.R`


### After-Class Updates

There seems to be some differences in how R reads in webscraped data between Windows and Mac. Windows users
will have a problem with the `wp_data$p_need_grant` variable, which gets read as a character vector and not a numerical variable.

The solution is to replace lines 122-126 in `Lec02.R` from

~~~
wp_data <- wp_data %>%
  mutate(
    comp_fee = currency_to_numeric(comp_fee),
    ave_no_need_grant = currency_to_numeric(ave_no_need_grant)
  )
~~~

to 

~~~
wp_data <- wp_data %>%
  mutate(
    comp_fee = currency_to_numeric(comp_fee),
    ave_no_need_grant = currency_to_numeric(ave_no_need_grant),
    p_need_grant = currency_to_numeric(ave_no_need_grant)
  )
~~~

i.e. use the `currency_to_numeric()` function to convert on `p_need_grant` as well. `Lec02.R` on GitHub has now been updated to reflect this change.
