# Overall Goals and Principles

You will undertake a data science project on a topic of your choice. The project
is an opportunity to show off what you've learned about data science.  Your task
is to use data to tell us something interesting. This project is deliberately
open-ended to allow you to fully explore your creativity. Here are the main
rules that must be followed:

1. **Use the materials learned in this class.**  Both the computational and
statistical tools learned.
1. **Your project must be centered around real data.** You will work with large,
complex, and/or messy data. While this is not an explicit requirement of the
project, the more challenging your data set is, the more you will have to use
the tools learned in this class.  For example, one thing that will make your
data science project more ambitious is combining two or more data sets that are
not directly related.
1. **Your project must tell us something.** There is a range of data science
projects that can satisfy this. We've seen a range of examples over the course
of the semester.  On one extreme would be a strict visualization based project
that involves little statistical analysis. On the other extreme are *data
mining/machine learning* projects, which involve no visualization. Your project
can be anywhere on this spectrum, but expectations may be different depending on
where you are on the scale. An example of a project that doesn't tell us
anything, would be something that downloads a single data source and summarizes
it, with some perfunctory visualization. Make sure that your project is
thought-provoking and has some underlying meaning!
1. **Cleverness and creativity will be rewarded.**  Going above and beyond what
we did in class will be rewarded.
1. **Collaboration.** You may discuss your project with other students, but each
of you will have a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help
each other. You may consult other sources, but you should credit these sources
in your report. Feel free to consult with me.







# Components

## Proposal

Your proposal is to be submitted 
in print or electronically.  Once you decide on a topic that interests you,
think about what you would like to end up with as a final result without
worrying about how to get there. Try to visualize what your end product will
look like. Will it be an interactive map? A predictive model? Don't think about
coding, or a particular data set, or what you know how to do now. If you come up
with something ambitious and original, you'll be more motivated to learn new
things as you go in order to accomplish your goal.  The topic is completely open
to your choice, but keep in mind the rules listed above.

### Content {#content .unnumbered}

Your proposals should contain the following content:

1. **Title**: The title of your project
1. **Purpose**: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to explore, as well
some carefully considered questions that you hope to address. You should make an
argument *motivating* your work. Why should someone be interested in what you
are doing? What do you hope people will learn from your project?
1. **Data**: As best you can, describe where you will find your data, and what 
*kind* of data it is. Will you be working with spatial data in shapefiles? Where
will you be accessing you data? Be as specific as you can, listing URLs and file
formats if possible.
1. **Variables**: List, and briefly describe, each variable that you plan to
incorporate. If you can, be specific about units, scale, etc.
1. **End Product**: Describe what you hope to deliver as a final product.
    + Will it be an interactive application that will be posted on the Internet?
    + Will it be a paper that draws some statistical conclusions?
    + Will it be a predictive model that forecasts future values?
1. **Honor Code**: Indicate if any component of this project overlaps with work
for another class/thesis. If this is the case, please speak to your 
professor/advisor and have them email me their consent by the due date of the proposal.

## Presentation

An effective oral presentation is an integral part of this project. One of the
objectives of this class is to give you experience conveying the results of a
technical investigation to a non-technical audience in a way that they can
understand. Whether you choose to stay in academia or pursue a career in
industry, the ability to communicate clearly is of paramount importance. As a
data scientist, the burden of proof is on you to convince your audience that
what you are saying is true. If your audience (who may very well be less
knowledgeable about statistics than you are) cannot understand your results or
their interpretations, then the technical merit of your project is irrelevant.

During the last 4 lectures, exam week you will each give a 12 minute
presentation of your work. Your goal should be to convey to your audience a
clear understanding of your research topic, along with a basic understanding of
your project, and how well it addresses the research question you posed. You
should **not** tell us everything that you did, or show a bunch of things that
you tried that didn't work well. After hearing your talk, each student in the
class should be able to answer:

1. What was your project about?
1. What was your data like, and what techniques did you apply to it?
1. What were your findings?

You should prepare electronic slides for your talk. PowerPoint is fine, but you
might also want to consider

  * RStudio tools:
      + Markdown slides [ioslides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html)
      + [Slidy](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/slidy_presentation_format.html)
      + Beamer (LaTeX)
  * Google Presentations


### Advice {.unnumbered}


* Budget your time. You only have 12 minutes and we will be running a very tight
schedule. Plan for 10 minutes to talk, and 2 minutes to answer questions.
Rehearse your talk ahead of time several times in order to get a better feel for
your timing.
* As a rule of thumb I use the one minute per slide rule.  
* Don't write too much on each slide. You don't want people to have to read your
slides, because if the audience is reading your slides, then they aren't
listening to you. 
* Put your problem in context. Remember that most of your audience will have
little or no knowledge of your subject matter. The easiest way to lose people is
to dive right into technical details that require prior domain knowledge. Spend
a few minutes at the beginning of your talk introducing your audience to the
most basic aspects of your topic and present some motivation for what you are
studying.
* Speak loudly and clearly. Remember that you know more about your topic that
anyone else in the room, so speak and act with confidence!


## Write-Up

Your write-up has to be a reproducible R Markdown HTML document that when 
printed is of length no more than 15 pages.  i.e. I should be able to recreate 
your entire analysis with one click of the mouse. 

In your write-up, you should tell a data science audience about your project,
why they should care about it, and what you have discovered. Your audience will
be people like you:  current or aspiring data scientists. Keep in mind that this
audience is extraordinarily diverse in terms of skills and abilities, so you
should assume very little about what they might know. However, your audience is
reasonably tech-savvy, so you need not "dumb-down" your analysis.  Your write-up
should make it clear to me and any other student in the class what methods and
techniques you have used to produce your finished product.

### Content {.unnumbered}

Do not present *all* of the `R` code that you wrote throughout the process of
working on this project. In fact

* The amount of R code in the outputted document should be minimal. The less R
code the better.
* Important conclusions should appear in the main text, not in comments in the code.
* The R markdown file should contain the *necessary* and *sufficient* (i.e.
minimal) set of `R` code that is necessary to understand your results and
findings. If you make a claim, it *must* be justified by explicit calculation. 
A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to reproduce your analysis:
    + Compile your `.Rmd` file without modification
    + Verify every statement that you have made.

### Motivation {.unnumbered}

Be sure to motivate your topic at the beginning of your write-up. You should try
to hook the reader early on. Assume that your audience is a skeptical data
scientist who has stumbled across your report but has very little time to read
it. Can you give them a reason to continue reading? A cool visualization or
result can help.

### Format {.unnumbered}

You don't need to follow a specific format in the write-up, but you should start
with an introductory paragraph and finish with a conclusion. Your write-up
should address the following questions:

1.  Why should anyone care about this?
2.  What is this about? Do *not* assume that your readers have any domain
knowledge! The burden of explanation as to what you are talking about is on you!
For example, if your project involves phyllogenetic trees, do not assume that
your audience has anything other than a basic, lay understanding of genetics.
3.  Where did your data come from? What kind of data was it? Is there a link to
the data or some other way for the reader to follow up on your work?
4.  What are your findings?  What kind of statistical computations (if any) have
you done to support those conclusions? Again, while the `R` code will show you
performing the calculation, it is up to you to interpret, in English sentences,
the results of these calculations. Do not forget about units, axis labels, etc.
5.  What are the limitations of your work? Be clear so that others do not
misinterpret your findings. To what population do your results apply? Do they
generalize?  How could your study be improved? Suggesting plausible extensions
don't weaken your work, they strengthen it by connecting it to future work.


### Style {.unnumbered}

The write-up can have interactive components. Take advantage of this by
including hyperlinks, figures, videos, etc. to provide context for the reader.
You can even include a
[bibiliography](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html),
and your references should be embedded via links. Use Markdown elements like
links, lists, LaTeX, and images as needed.

Visualizations, particularly interactive ones, will be well-received. That said,
do not overuse visualizations. You may be better off with one complicated but
well-crafted visualization as opposed to many quick-and-dirty plots. Any plots
should be well-thought out, properly labelled, informative, and visually
appealing!







# Evalution

## Overall

Your term project will be evaluated based:

* **Originality/Interest**: Is the topic original, interesting, and substantial,
or is it trite, pedantic, and trivial? How much creativity, initiative, and
ambition did you demonstrate? Is the basic question driving the project worth
investigating, or is it obviously answerable without a data-based study?
* **Degree of Difficulty**: How challenging was the project? Were the data
particularly large, complex, and/or messy? Did the data come in an obscure
format?Was a challenging visualization or applet constructed? Were any elements
from outside the coursework necessary to complete the project?
* **Design**: How well were the graphical elements of the project designed? Were
they clunky or elegant? Was a truly original view of the data presented? Were
any interactive elements usable?
* **Meaning/Analysis/Statistical Understanding**: Did we learn anything
meaningful from this project? Are the chosen analyses appropriate for the
variables/relationships under investigation, and are the assumptions underlying
these analyses met? Are the analyses carried out correctly? Did you make
appropriate conclusions from the analyses, and are these conclusions justified?
* **Write-Up**: How effectively does the write-up communicate the goals,
procedures, and results of the study? Are the claims adequately supported? Does
the writing style enhance what you are trying to communicate? How well is it
edited? Are the statistical claims justified? Are text and analyses effectively
interwoven?
* **Oral Presentation**: How effectively does the oral presentation communicate
the goals, procedures, and results of the study? Do the slides help to
illustrate the points being made by the speaker without distracting the
audience? Does the presenter seem to be well-rehearsed? Did they properly budget
their time? Do they appear to be confident in what they are is saying? Are their
arguments persuasive?


## Peer Presentation Evaluation

Your assistance is required in anonymously evaluating the presentations of your
peers. The questions below are an example of what I ask you to answer to
evaluate your peers' oral presentations:

* **Volume**: Are the speakers loud enough? Can you hear them even in the back
of the room?
* **Presence**: Do the speakers command the room? Do they draw your attention or
do they just look like they want this to be over as soon as possible?
* **Emphasis**: Do the speakers use intonation to signal what words or concepts
are most important? Or do they appear to be reciting a speech flatly?
* **Eye Contact**: Are the speakers engaged with the audience? Do they seem
connected or do they seem to be going through the motions?
* **Clarity**: Did the speakers convey a clear sense of what the project is
about? If you had to tell someone what their project was about in three
sentences could you do it?
* **Mastery**: Do the speakers appear to have full command of the material? Were
there obvious gaps in their knowledge of the subject matter? Were they able to
answer questions coherently?
