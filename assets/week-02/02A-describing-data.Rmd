## Describing Distributions {.build}

- **Shape**: modality, skewness
- **Center**: mean, median, mode
- **Spread**: variance, sd, range, IQR
- **Unusual observations**: outliers


## Shape {.build}

**Modality**

<img src="../figs/modality.png" alt="modality" width="750">

**Skewness**

<img src="../figs/skewness.png" alt="skewness" width="750">


## Shape Q

Which of these variables do you expect to be uniformly distributed?

1. weights of adult females
2. salaries of a random sample of people from Oregon
3. house prices
4. birthdays of classmates (day of the month)


## Center: mean {.build}

```{r}
X <- c(8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11, 9, 6, 10, 7, 9)
```



\[ \frac{8 + 11 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 7 + 9}{11} = \frac{93}{11} = 8.45 \\
  \\
\]

**Sample mean**: the arithmetic mean of the data (vs *pop mean*)

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \quad \quad \textrm{vs.} \quad \quad \mu\]

```{r}
mean(X)
```


## Center: median {.build}

**Median**: the middle value of a sorted data set.

```{r}
sort(X)
median(X)
```

Break ties by averaging middle two if necessary.


## Center: mode {.build}

**Mode**: the most frequently observed value in the data set.

```{r}
table(X)
```


## The Typical Human

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2xOvKFFz4)

Keep note of the measures of "typical" that are reported - they come quick!


## Spread: variance {.build}

**Sample variance**: roughly, the mean squared deviation from the mean.

\[ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\]

Compare to the *population variance*, $\sigma^2$, which divides by $n$.


## Spread: variance {.build}

```{r}
X - mean(X)
(X - mean(X))^2
sum((X - mean(X))^2) / (length(X) - 1)
var(X)
```


## Spread: standard deviation {.build}

**Sample standard deviation**: the square root of the variance. Used because
units are the same as the data.

\[ s = \sqrt(s^2) \]

```{r}
sqrt(var(X))
sd(X)
```

Compared to the *population standard deviation*, $\sigma$.


## Spread: IQR {.build}

**Inner Quartile Range**: the range of the middle 50% of the data.

\[ IQR = Q3 - Q1 \]

```{r}
sort(X)
IQR(X)
```


## Spread: range {.build}

**Range**: the range of the full data set.

\[ range = max - min \]

```{r}
max(X) - min(X)
range(X)
```


## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be sensitive to the presence of outliers?

1. variance
2. standard deviation
3. IQR
4. Range


## Spread Q {.build}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Y <- X
Y[1] <- 37
```


```{r}
X
Y
var(X)
var(Y)
```


## Spread Q {.build}

```{r}
IQR(X)
IQR(Y)
range(X)
range(Y)
```


## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be sensitive to the presence of outliers?

1. **variance**
2. **standard deviation**
3. IQR
4. **Range**


## Center Q

Which measure(s) of center would be sensitive to the presence of outliers?

1. mean
2. median
3. mode


## Center Q

Which measure(s) of center would be sensitive to the presence of outliers?

1. **mean**
2. median
3. mode


## Mean vs median {.build}

<img src="../figs/skew-sym.png" alt="skewsym" width="750">

The mean (red line) is sensitive to extreme values, so it gets pulled towards 
the tail. The median (dashed line) is less sensitive.

For symmetric dists, use *mean* and *sd*.

For skewed dists, use *median* and *iqr*.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(rgamma(50, 2, 3),
       5 - rgamma(50, 2, 3),
       rnorm(50))
y <- factor(rep(c("ls", "rs", "sym"), each = 50))
df <- data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, groups = y)) + geom_density()
```
