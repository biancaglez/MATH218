While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit your
own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.


### Problem Set 01

* **Info:**
    + Assigned Wed 2/15
    + Due Fri 2/24 9am
* **Learning Goals:**
    + Getting familiar with Kaggle competition workflow
    + Allow time for `tidyverse` newbies to get up to speed
* **Notes**:
    + Don't focus on memorizing anything for now, just complete the assignment.
    + If you find yourself spinning your wheels, let me know.
    + **New**: Kaggle is very finicky about the submission format. If you're having trouble, see <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://github.com/rudeboybert/MATH218/blob/gh-pages/assets/Titanic/kaggle.R">`kaggle.R`</a> for a discussion.
* **Homework:**
    + `tidyverse` newbies: Do DataCamp classes listed in Lec02.
    + Baby's first Kaggle competition: Titanic
        + Create a model that predicts `Survival` other than ones we've seen.
        + Submit the predictions CSV so that your ranking shows.
        + Slack message me your Kaggle name so I can find you in the rankings.

## Problem Set 01

* Assigned Fri 9/16
* Due Fri 9/23

#### Learning Goals

* This week's problem set doesn't involve much content, but rather is about
familiarizing yourselves with the problem set workflow and submission format using R
Markdown.
* In particular, we'll go over how to share your analyses over the web with a couple of clicks of the mouse!
* You'll start
    + seeing what I mean by "computers are stupid"
    + develop the skill of "debugging": identifying and removing errors from
    code. In our case, if your R Markdown file won't knit AKA load AKA compile 
    AKA render, follow the steps in [R Markdown 
    debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/edit?usp=sharing)
    (also posted on the Resources page). This usually solves about 85% of
    problems; if you're still stuck after going through the steps, speak to your
    peers or me.
* In my experience, there are always a few hiccups with R Markdown at the
beginning, but by the third assignment everyone is on board.

#### Homework

* Download this file to your computer, then upload it to the RStudio Server as described in Lec03: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PS/PS-01.Rmd" target="_blank">`PS-01.Rmd`</a>
* ~~Submit your homework using this [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n1HNo17MA21-DQ_boklchwCjfr6_qx7GrLY5ot7796g/edit)~~. See below.

## Problem Set Submission Process

Using <a target="_blank" class="page-link"
href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/211659737-Sharing-Projects-in-RStudio-Server-Pro">RStudio
Server project sharing</a> (which you'll also be using for your group projects)! The grader and I will go over and leave comments directly on your problem set files.

**Only do this once:**

You will create a project (i.e. an organizational folder) that you will share
with me and the grader:

* In the top right of RStudio Server click on the cube with "R" in it -> New Project... -> Click "save" when prompted
* New Directory -> Empty Project -> Enter `problem_sets` as the Directory name and click "Create Project"
* On the top right it should say `problem_sets` next to the cube with "R" in it. Click on that -> Share Project...
* In the box with the blinking cursor add `aykim` and `tsingh`
* Copy the Project URL and press OK
* Paste your URL in the appropriate row in this <a target="_blank" class="page-link"
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18alOq3kFV58LepI-UZ1swl9qPWHoa0VfHnLm3S5ldXg/edit#gid=1771999784">Google Sheet</a>

**Only for problem set 1:**

Move the file `PS-01.Rmd` to the `problem_sets` shared project folder so the grader and I can access it:

* In the Files panel -> Click on the house icon
* Click the checkboxes next to `PS-01.Rmd` and `PS-01.html`
* Click the gear icon "More" -> Move...
* Select `problem_sets`

**For all future problem sets:**

* When uploading the relevant `PS-XX.Rmd` file to RStudio Server, upload it directly to the `problem_sets` folder.
