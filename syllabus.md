## Course Description and Objectives

<!--#### Description-->

This course is an introduction to modern statistical, machine learning, and
computational methods to analyze large and complex data sets that arise in a
variety of fields, from biology to economics to astrophysics. The theoretical
underpinnings of the most important modeling and predictive methods will be
covered, including regression, classification, clustering, resampling, and
tree-based methods. Student work will involve implementation of these concepts
using open-source computational tools.

## Materials

#### 1) Textbook

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR) by James,
Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. A PDF of the text can be found on the book's
<a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">homepage</a>.


#### 2) Computing and Software

We will chiefly be using R via the RStudio integrated development environment
(IDE). Please see [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting_started/) 
for all the software and accounts we will be using.





## Evaluation

There are four components to your final grade: problem sets, 3 midterms, engagement,
and the final project.

#### 1) Problem Sets 10%

The weekly problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes
opportunities to develop one's machine learning toolbox and receive feedback on
the progress of one's learning, instead of evaluative tools used by the
instructor to assign grades. To reinforce this thinking, each homework is worth
only a nominal portion of the final grade. However, not making an honest effort
on the homeworks will ultimately hurt you for your (individual) final project.

Collaboration on the homeworks is highly encouraged as in many situations 
learning is best done in groups. However you must submit your own answers and
not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all collaborations must
be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.

* Assigned/due on Fridays.
* Lowest two scores dropped.
* No email submissions will be accepted; ask a classmate to print it for you.
* No extensions for any problem sets will be granted. 


#### 2) 3 Midterms 45%

* Midterm dates: Wed 3/15 (in-class), Wed 4/19 (evening: location TBD), and during finals week.
* There is no extra-credit work to improve midterm scores after the fact.
* There will be no make-up nor rescheduled midterms, except in the following
cases if documentation is provided:
    + serious illness or death in the family.
    + athletic commitments or religious obligations if and prior notice is
    given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken **before** the rest of
    the class.




#### 3) Engagement 10%

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student", so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: **you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in**. Some examples of behavior counter to this
principle:

* Merely attending lectures and not participating in discussions.
* Leveraging previous experience in other settings to coast through this course.
* Not coming to office hours when the situation warrants it. 
* Submitting homework that has code or content that is copied from (or only
slightly modified versions of) your peers' work, going against the philosophy of
the homeworks being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as items 
to be graded on.


#### 4) Final Project 35%

Much of this course is a build up to the final project, which is a capstone 
experience synthesizing everything you've learned over the course of the 
semester. You will be participating in a Kaggle (rhymes with haggle)
competition: <a target="_blank" class="page-link"

## Academic Accommodations for Disabilities

Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need
accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the
semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student
Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at
[litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more
information. All discussions will remain confidential.
