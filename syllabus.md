## MATH 216: Fall 2016

* **Instructor:** [Albert Y. Kim](https://rudeboybert.github.io/) - Assistant Professor of Statistics
* **Email:** [aykim@middlebury.edu](aykim@middlebury.edu)
    + I will respond to emails within 24h, but not during weekends.
    + Please only email me with administrative and briefer questions as I prefer addressing more substantive questions in person.
* **Class Location/Time:**
    + MWF 9:05-9:55 in Warner 506.
    + Davis Library 105A (downstairs on the right) on the following days:  
    Wed 10/12, Wed 10/26, Wed 11/9, Mon 11/28.
    + You do not need to inform me of absenses. Please consult your peers for what you missed.
* **Office Hours:** Warner 310 or the math lounge just outside. Feel free to come to the [MATH 116](https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH116/) office hours as well, but those students get priority then. 
    + M 1:00-2:30 and W 2:30-4:00
    + MATH 116: M 2:30-4:00 and W 1:00-2:30
    + Or by appointment





## Course Description and Objectives

<!--#### Description-->

In this course students will gain exposure to the entire data science pipeline: 
forming a statistical question, collecting and cleaning data sets, performing 
exploratory data analyses, identifying appropriate statistical techniques, and 
communicating the results, all the while leaning heavily on open source 
computational tools, in particular the R statistical software language. We will 
focus on analyzing real, messy, and large data sets, requiring the use of 
advanced data manipulation/wrangling and data visualization packages. Students 
will be required to bring their own laptops as many lectures will involve 
in-class computational activities.

<!--#### Objectives-->





## Topics

Roughly speaking we will cover the following topics (a more detailed outline can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msrQOV0zFjc5VUamFhRltz8GhS-uF010_rfaSwtTVXU/edit#gid=0)):

1. Data manipulation and visualization
1. Regression
1. Dates and times
1. Maps and spatial data
1. Text data





## Materials

#### 1) Textbook

There is no textbook to purchase; as much as possible, we will rely on 
open-source and freely available materials on the web.

#### 2) Computing and Software

We will chiefly be using R via the RStudio integrated development
environment (IDE). Please see [Some Link]({% post-url 2016-09-12-getting-started %})





## Evaluation

There are four components to your final grade: homeworks, quizzes, engagement, and the final project.

#### 1) Homeworks 10%

Over the course of the semester, you will be 

Each homework is worth only a nominal portion of the final grade. As such, 
instead of viewing them as evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign 
grades, they should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to develop one's data
science toolbox and receive feedback on the progress of one's learning.

Furthermore, collaboration on the homeworks is **highly** encouraged as in 
practice learning in many situations is best done in groups, especially when it
comes to coding. However, collaboration taken too far is copying. Not making an
honest effort on the homeworks will ultimately hurt you for your (individual) 
final project.

Details:

* Due on GitHub at 9am on the relevant Wednesday.
* **Honor code**: All collaborations must be explicity acknowledged at the beginning of your submissions.
* Practice question


#### 2) Quizzes 20%

There will be a weekly quiz at the beginning of lecture on Mondays. The level of
these quizzes will be such that they don't require extensive studying; if you 
actively participate in class and are keeping up with the material, you will do
fine. Notes:

* It is your responsibility to be on time.
* There will be no makeup quizzes.
* The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.


#### 3) Engagement 10%

It is difficult to explicity codify what constitutes "an engaged student", so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: **you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in**. Some examples of behavior counter to this
principle:

* Merely attending lectures and not participating in discussions.
* Leveraging previous experience in other settings to coast through this course.
* Not coming to office hours when the situation warrants it. 
* Submitting homework that has code or content that is copied from (or only
slightly modified versions of) your peers' work, going against the philosophy of
the homeworks being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as items 
to be graded on.


#### 4) Final Project 60%

Much of this course is a build up to the final project, which is a capstone
experience synthesizing everything you've learned over the course of the
semester. There are 3 components to the total 50%

* Project proposal due Friday 11/4
* Write-up 40%: Due on XXX
* Approximately 10 min oral presentation 15%: During the last 4 lectures with the presentation order determined at random a few weeks before. 
* Evaluation of your peers' final presentations 5%: You will be giving (anonymized) feedback on all presentations, on which you'll be graded
on the quality of your feedback.

## Academic Accommodations for Disabilities

Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
