# Lec02 - Wed 2/15: 

## Toolbox

1. `R`: `tidyverse` and the pipe operator `%>%`
1. DataCamp
1. Kaggle



## Tool 1: `tidyverse`

`tidyverse` is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

Read more on [RStudio's Blog](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/).



## `tidyverse` Core Packages

These get loaded when you run `library(tidyverse)`

> * `ggplot2` for data visualisation.
> * `dplyr` for data manipulation.
> * `tidyr` for data tidying.
> * `readr` for data import.
> * `purrr` for functional programming.
> * `tibble` for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.



## `tidyverse` Non-Core Packages

These get installed with `tidyverse`

> * `hms` for times.
> * `stringr` for strings.
> * `lubridate` for date/times.
> * `forcats` for factors.



## `tidyverse` Data Import Packages

These get installed with `tidyverse`

> * `DBI` for databases.
> * `haven` for SPSS, SAS and Stata files.
> * `httr` for web apis.
> * `jsonlite` for JSON.
> * `readxl` for .xls and .xlsx files.
> * `rvest` for web scraping.
> * `xml2` for XML.



## `tidyverse` Modelling Packages

These get installed with `tidyverse`

> * `modelr` for simple modelling within a pipeline
> * `broom` for turning models into tidy data



## Tool 2: DataCamp

* Browser-based interactive tool for learning R/python
* Interface is like RStudio: wrapper around R console
* You all have access to [ALL courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/) for free for the semester!



## DataCamp 

If you are new to...

* `ggplot2`: Package for Data Visualization, do Data Visualization with ggplot2 [(Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1), [(Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2), and [(Part 3)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-part-3)
* `dplyr`: Package for Data Manipulation, do [Data Manipulation in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial) and [Joining Data in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr).
* R Markdown: Creating reproducible reports do [Reporting with R Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)



## Tool 3: Kaggle

* Baby's first Kaggle competition entry!
* Tutorial on their most popular competition for beginners [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).



## Titanic Data

For $i=1,\ldots,n$ passengers

* ID variable: `PassengerId`
* Outcome variable $y_i$: `Survived` (binary)
* 10 Predictors/covariates $\vec{X}_i$ i.e. information about the passenger: `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`. 



## Models for Predicting Survival:

Na√Øve models: Use no information about the passenger, i.e. no covariates

1. Everyone dies: Predict
    + `Survived == 0`
1. Everyone lives: Predict
    + `Survived == 1`
1. Flip a weighted coin. Predict
    + `Survived == 1` with probability $p$
    + `Survived == 0` with probability $1-p$


## Models for Predicting Survival:

* Instead, let's use some information about the passengers: `Sex`? 
* Our model: Predict:
    + `Survived == 1` if `Sex == "female"`
    + `Survived == 0` if `Sex == "male"`



## Outline of Competition

Chalk talk i.e. see your lecture notes. 



## Titanic Data

Load CSV's into R:

```{r, message=FALSE}
gender_submission <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/gender_submission.csv")
test <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/test.csv")
train <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/train.csv")
```

* You may need to change your directory path.
* `readr::` just indicates the function is from the `readr` package. Use for disambiguation.



## Training Set

The binary outcome varible `Survived` is included.

```{r}
glimpse(train)
```


## Test Set

`Survived` is now **NOT** included. There are 418 rows (passengers) you need to predict.

```{r}
glimpse(test)
```


## Submission Example

This is what you submit: 418 rows with

> * the ID variable `PassengerId`
> * your **predicted** outcome variable `Survived`

```{r}
glimpse(gender_submission)
```


## Submission Example

You can write to CSV via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gender_submission %>% readr::write_csv("assets/Titanic/submission.csv")
```


## Submission Example

After submitting to Kaggle, you can see your ranking.

# Lec01 - Mon 2/13: Introduction

## What is statistical/machine learning?

<center><img src="assets/figure/data_science_3.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



## What is statistical/machine learning?

* In Feb 2016, I agonized over title of course: "Statistical Learning" vs "Machine Learning"
* In Summer 2016: Ben Baumer at Smith posed:
* *"Instead of obsessing over Venn diagrams of what topics are within the domains of which disciplines, I ask instead..."*
* *"... What if we blew up math, stats, CS, and all their legacies and started over? What would this field look like?"*
* New moniker: Machine learning... taught from a statistician's perspective



## Definitions

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Me: Prediction



## Examples:

* [Self-Driving Vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/)
* Netflix recommendations
* Simple linear regression



## Background

* In the past, lots and lots of mathmatical science pre-requisites: algorithms, probability, linear algebra, etc.
* Brought to you from folks at Stanford in 2001: <center><img src="assets/figure/ESL.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>



## Unchartered Territory

* New model: flatter pre-requisite structure. That means we'll have a few digressions for probability, linear algebra, etc.
* Brought to you from folks at Stanford (again) in 2013: <center><img src="assets/figure/ISLR.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>



## Unchartered Territory

* Book is still much like beta version of software:
     + New, exciting, and cutting edge but...
     + Lots bugs
* Battle tested with: <center><img src="assets/figure/mhusseinmidd_anon.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>
* Smith College SDS Initiative <https://github.com/SmithCollege-SDS/tidy-islr>



## Toolbox

<center><img src="assets/figure/tools.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>


* [R vs Python](https://www.google.com/search?q=r+vs+python). A hammer vs a screwdriver
* Argument for R: Wickham's [Tidy tools manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html)
    + Reuse existing data structures: Consistency across packages e.g. `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `modelr`
    + Design for humans: Bottleneck in most data analysis is thinking time, not computing time. i.e. avoid **premature optimization**
    


## Cornerstone of Course

Final Project: Kaggle (rhymes with haggle)
[competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).
