# Lec01 - Mon 2/13: Introduction

## What is statistical/machine learning?

## What is statistical/machine learning?

* In Feb 2016, I agonized over title of course: "Statistical Learning" vs "Machine Learning"
* In Summer 2016: Ben Baumer at Smith posed:
* *"Instead of obsessing over Venn diagrams of what topics are within the domains of which disciplines, I ask instead..."*
* *"... What if we blew up math, stats, CS, and all their legacies and started over? What would this field look like?"*
* New moniker: Machine learning... taught from a statistician's perspective



## Definitions

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Me: Prediction



## Examples:

* [Self-Driving Vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/)
* Netflix recommendations
* Simple linear regression



## Background

* In the past, lots and lots of mathmatical science pre-requisites: algorithms, probability, linear algebra, etc.
* Brought to you from folks at Stanford in 2001: <center><img src="assets/figure/ESL.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>



## Unchartered Territory

* New model: flatter pre-requisite structure. That means we'll have a few digressions for probability, linear algebra, etc.
* Brought to you from folks at Stanford (again) in 2013: <center><img src="assets/figure/ISLR.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>



## Unchartered Territory

* Book is still much like beta version of software:
     + New, exciting, and cutting edge but...
     + Lots bugs
* Battle tested with: <center><img src="assets/figure/mhusseinmidd_anon.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/></center>
* Smith College SDS Initiative <https://github.com/SmithCollege-SDS/tidy-islr>



## Toolbox

<center><img src="./assets/figure/tools.jpg" height="200px"/></center>

* [R vs Python](https://www.google.com/search?q=r+vs+python). A hammer vs a screwdriver
* Argument for R: Wickham's [Tidy tools manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html)
    + Reuse existing data structures: Consistency across packages e.g. `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `modelr`
    + Design for humans: Bottleneck in most data analysis is thinking time, not computing time. i.e. avoid **premature optimization**

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. `rnorm()`


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
