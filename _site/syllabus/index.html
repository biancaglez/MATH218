<h2 id="course-description-and-objectives">Course Description and Objectives</h2>

<p>In this course students will gain exposure to the entire data science pipeline:
forming a statistical question, collecting and cleaning data sets, performing
exploratory data analyses, identifying appropriate statistical techniques, and
communicating the results, all the while leaning heavily on open source
computational tools, in particular the R statistical software language. We will
focus on analyzing real, messy, and large data sets, requiring the use of
advanced data manipulation/wrangling and data visualization packages. Students
will be required to bring their own laptops as many lectures will involve
in-class computational activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>College Writing</li>
  <li>Align how learning is done in practice.</li>
  <li>Differs from traditional stats, tacit knowledge, no right/wrong answers, only feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<h4 id="textbook">1) Textbook</h4>

<p>There is no textbook to purchase; as much as possible, we will rely on
open-source and freely available materials on the web.</p>

<h4 id="computing-and-software">2) Computing and Software</h4>

<p>As stated in the course description, you must bring a laptop to each lecture. If you 
do not have access to a laptop, please let me know.</p>

<p>Instead of a local desktop version of the RStudio integrated development
environment (IDE) for R, we will be using the cloud-based RStudio Server
interface, which you can access via 
<a href="https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">go/rstudio</code></a>. Note if you are off-campus you 
must first log into the <a href="http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access">Middlebury
VPN</a>.</p>

<p>You are free to work with a local desktop version of RStudio, but you are 
responsible for installing all necessary packages and extensions on your own as
I will not be offering technical support during the semester. If you have such
questions after the semester is over, feel free to ask.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>There are four components to your final grade: homeworks, quizzes, engagement, and the final project.</p>

<h4 id="homeworks-10">1) Homeworks 10%</h4>

<p>Over the course of the semester, you will be</p>

<p>Each homework is worth only a nominal portion of the final grade. As such, 
instead of viewing them as evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign 
grades, they should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to develop one’s data
science toolbox and receive feedback on the progress of one’s learning.</p>

<p>Furthermore, collaboration on the homeworks is <strong>highly</strong> encouraged as in 
practice learning in many situations is best done in groups, especially when it
comes to coding. However, collaboration taken too far is copying. Not making an
honest effort on the homeworks will ultimately hurt you for your (individual) 
final project.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Due on GitHub at 9am on the relevant Wednesday.</li>
  <li><strong>Honor code</strong>: All collaborations must be explicity acknowledged at the beginning of your submissions.</li>
  <li>Practice question</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quizzes-20">2) Quizzes 20%</h4>

<p>There will be a weekly quiz at the beginning of lecture on Mondays. The level of
these quizzes will be such that they don’t require extensive studying; if you 
actively participate in class and are keeping up with the material, you will do
fine. Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is your responsibility to be on time.</li>
  <li>There will be no makeup quizzes.</li>
  <li>The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="engagement-10">3) Engagement 10%</h4>

<p>It is difficult to explicity codify what constitutes “an engaged student”, so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: <strong>you’ll only get
out of this class as much as you put in</strong>. Some examples of behavior counter to this
principle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merely attending lectures and not participating in discussions.</li>
  <li>Leveraging previous experience in other settings to coast through this course.</li>
  <li>Not coming to office hours when the situation warrants it.</li>
  <li>Submitting homework that has code or content that is copied from (or only
slightly modified versions of) your peers’ work, going against the philosophy of
the homeworks being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as items 
to be graded on.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-project-60">4) Final Project 60%</h4>

<p>Much of this course is a build up to the final project, which is a capstone
experience synthesizing everything you’ve learned over the course of the
semester. There are 3 components to the total 50%</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project proposal due Friday 11/4</li>
  <li>Write-up 40%: Due on XXX</li>
  <li>Approximately 10 min oral presentation 15%: During the last 4 lectures with the presentation order determined at random a few weeks before.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of your peers’ final presentations 5%: You will be giving (anonymized) feedback on all presentations, on which you’ll be graded
on the quality of your feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="academic-accommodations-for-disabilities">Academic Accommodations for Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at <a href="litchfie@middlebury.edu">litchfie@middlebury.edu</a> or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.</p>
