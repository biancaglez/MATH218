## Homework 0

Homework 0 is posted
[here](https://github.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0). It does not
involve any content; it will merely be a practice run of the homework submission
process for the semester. I expect there to be some hiccups this first go round.
As such, I suggest you start early. Do not spin your wheels if stuck, please speak to me. 

* Assigned 9am Wed 9/14
* Due 9am Wed 9/21
